# Checkout

This project is served on GitHub pages and acts as the checkout page for our products.


## Aim
- Create a single page for each product. Each page stands on it's own without connection to other pages.
- Each product has various pricing plans that user can choose from.
- Users will have to ensure that they add the correct email on the stripe checkout form.

## Development
- Install `serve` from npm globally
- run `serve` on the project base to start serving the project on localhost
